npm run electron:prod

new terminal tab

npm install --save-dev @electron/packager
npm run package-mac ("package-mac": "electron-packager . MyAppName --platform=darwin --extend-info=build/Info.plist --arch=x64 --out=release-builds --overwrite")

Run this command in your terminal, from the project's root directory:

Bash
npm run package-mac
Here's what should happen when you run this:

prepackage-mac runs: This script executes npm run build.
npm run build runs: This executes next build, which (since output: 'export' is removed) will create the production server build in the .next folder.
package-mac runs: This executes the electron-packager . MyAppName ... command. Because we adjusted the --ignore flags (or removed some), it should now bundle:
Your electron-main.js.
Your package.json.
The .next folder containing the Next.js production build.
Your node_modules (ideally pruned to production dependencies, though the simple ignore flags might grab everything).
Your build/Info.plist.
Any other files not explicitly ignored.

Go back because release will be purged, can't run from there.
